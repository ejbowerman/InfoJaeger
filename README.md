Python 3 scripts to retrieve useful data on IP's from ARIN.

Create a "hosts.txt" file in the same directory as the script. Use one IP per line. The output is placed in an "output.txt" file. Note that the output.txt file is the full JSON retrieved from ARIN. The script outputs to STDOUT filtered info, which can be changed depending on your needs.
